    "\n",
    "If the calculated F-statistic (1.5 in this case) is greater than the critical F-value at the 0.975 quantile or less than the critical F-value at the 0.025 quantile, then you would reject the null hypothesis, suggesting a significant difference in variances.\n",
    "If it falls within these critical values, then you do not reject the null hypothesis, suggesting no significant difference in variances."
